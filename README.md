Currently, doctors wishing to gauge the severity of Parkinson’s Disease in their patients must manually perform an examination. The examination includes testing motor functions to determine a standardized number (1-6) based on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The diagnoses are subjective, time consuming, and could produce different results depending on the opinions of the physician.

This mobile app automates motor tests (Pronation/Supination, Resting Tremors, Finger Tapping) to create uniformity in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. It uses the phone internal gyroscope and accelerometer to record data points.

The ultimate goal is to analyze patient data gathered by the app and perform pattern recognition to produce a final score representing a rating in the UPDRS.
